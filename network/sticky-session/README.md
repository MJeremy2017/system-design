# Sticky Session

Load balancer creates an affinity between client and a server in a fixed period of time.

With sticky sessions, a load balancer assigns an identifying attribute to a user, typically by issuing a cookie or by tracking 
their IP details. Then, according to the tracking ID, a load balancer can start routing 
all the requests of this user to a specific server for the duration of the session.

While HTTP/HTTPs is stateless, sticky session enables the server side to keep the state of a user(personalized data).
Otherwise, the server would have to maintain the data in a distributed manner, which is less efficient.


## Duration-based session persistence

Your **load balancer issues a cookie** that defines a specific timeframe for session stickiness. 
Each time the load balancer receives a client request, it checks whether this cookie is present.

After the specified duration elapses and the cookie expires, the session is not sticky anymore.

## Application-controlled session persistence

Your **application generates a cookie** that determines the duration of session stickiness.
The load balancer still issues its own session cookie on top of it, but it now follows the 
lifetime of the application cookie.

## Stateful Architecture

To authenticate User A, HTTP requests must be routed to Server 1. 
If a request is sent to other servers like Server 2, authentication would fail because Server 2 does not contain 
User Aâ€™s session data. Similarly, all HTTP requests from User B must be routed to Server 2; 
all requests from User C must be sent to Server 3.

The issue is that every request from the same client must be routed to the same server. 
This can be done with sticky sessions in most load balancers; 
however, this adds the overhead. 
**Adding or removing servers is much more difficult with this approach**. 
It is also challenging to handle server failures.

## Stateless Architecture

In this stateless architecture, HTTP requests from users can be sent to any web servers, 
which fetch state data from a shared data store. 
**State data is stored in a shared data store and kept out of web servers.**

```
A stateless system is simpler, more robust, and scalable.
