# Application Routing vs. Load Balancing

**Routing**: Route traffic to different applications based on the rules.

**Load balancing**: Distribute traffic to horizontal scaled services of the same application.


 Routing makes a decision on **where** to forward something â€“ a packet, an application request, 
 an approval in your business workflow. 
 
Load balancing distributes something (packets, requests, approval) **across a set of resources** designed 
to process that something.
