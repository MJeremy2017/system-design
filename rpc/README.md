# SSD vs. HDD

`SSD(Solid State Drive)` stores data in memory chip while `HDD(Hard Disk Drive)` stores data in hard disk.
`HDD` reading is mechanical by spinning platter to the read/write position which is much slower.

**HDDs:** In an HDD, an enclosure contains a series of platters covered by a ferromagnetic coating. 
The direction of the magnetization represents the individual bits. 
**Data is written and read by a fast-moving head**, similar to the way vinyl record albums work.
Since all of these pieces are “mechanical,” 
the hard disk is the slowest and most fragile component of any computer.

**SSDs:** SSDs are newer types of disks that store information on flash memory, 
which consists of individual memory cells storing bits that are instantly accessible by the controller.
