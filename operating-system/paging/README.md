# Paging

Paging is a memory management technique where a computer loads data from secondary memory to primary
memory.

Primary storage data is temporary and is frequently accessed by applications or other hardware systems. It is typically stored in random access memory (RAM) for fast retrieval. Secondary storage is where data in a computer is kept for longer periods of time. Secondary storage is typically slower than primary. 
A typical example of secondary memory could be a solid-state drive (SSD), for example.
