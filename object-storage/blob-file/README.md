# Blob vs. File Storage

Blob storage stores digital object like images, audios and videos in binary format. And the data stored
is **immutable**. What you store is what you get. One can add a new version to existing store but can not modify
what is uploaded.

File storage likes a local file system, one can update and modify what is stored and reuse the same url.
