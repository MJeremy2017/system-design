# Federation

Create a virtual layer that provides access to multiple different data sources.

- **No additional storage requirement**: Data federation software doesn’t copy data from 
individual databases to any repository. Since data integration carries out virtually, you don’t need to allocate separate storage space or hardware.
- **Faster access to data**: Data federation offers a single source to access any data. 
It eliminates the hassle of making queries in individual databases to get what you 
need by providing a single platform, enabling you to access data seamlessly and save time.
- **Ease of use**: Data federation tools don’t require you to possess knowledge of different coding languages. You need minimal coding knowledge to make queries and access the data.
- **Cheaper option with minimum risk**: Since data federation doesn’t create a separate copy of data, it prevents you from spending on costly storage hardware. At the same time, it minimizes the risk of data loss as there is no physical data movement.
