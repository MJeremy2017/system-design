# SQL vs. NoSQL

## SQL

- More structured data.
- Strong consistency (ACID).
- Satisfy complex join operation.
- Scaling: need to implement extra sharding logic.

## NoSQL

- Allow loose and flexible structured data.
- Easier to scale, mostly with build-in scaling strategy.
- Faster performance if well-designed.
- Complex join can be hard, may need to extra implement in the program.
